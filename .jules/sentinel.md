## 2025-05-22 - Server Hardening and Environment Fixes
**Vulnerability:** Missing security headers (`X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`, `X-XSS-Protection`) and exposed `X-Powered-By` header.
**Learning:** Hardening an Express server with security headers is a standard defense-in-depth measure. However, maintaining the build environment (fixing missing types and dependencies) is often necessary to ensure security improvements can be merged and verified by CI. Manual header configuration is a lightweight alternative to adding new runtime dependencies like `helmet` when constraints are tight.
**Prevention:** Regularly audit server entry points for missing security headers and ensure devDependencies like `@types/node` and testing tools like `vitest` are correctly configured to avoid "broken window" syndrome in CI/CD pipelines.
